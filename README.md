**Original Data source:** worldpopulationreview.com 
Most of the information was lacking some countries and had wrong data so only kept the country codes and names



**Driving Side:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-_and_right-hand_traffic

Will use the capital city's rules if it varies on area

**EXAMPLE:**
United Kingdom - mostly left side (including the mainland) but some over-seas drive on right (British Indian Ocean Territory, Gibraltar).


**Minimum licence age:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_driving_ages 
This list uses the absolute minimum age to obtain any type of car licence (e.g., learner's licence, provisional licence, full licence) in the capital city of each country

**EXAMPLE:**
Canada's minimum age to obtain a drivers licence is 16 including in Ottawa, the capital, but is 14 in Alberta. Here, Canada's minimum age will still be 16.
New Zealand is listed as 16, the minimum age to obtain a learner's licence for a Class 1 Vehicle ( a car )
